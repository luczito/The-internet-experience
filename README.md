# The Internet Experience
The purpose of The Internet Experience is to provide a platform where users can learn about the hostile and dark patterns that exist on the internet. 
These tactics, such as hidden opt-outs, misleading language, and false urgency, are deliberately used to benefit the owners of the site at the expense of the user.
The website is designed to mimic news / article pages and webshops, highlighting and exaggerating the toxic or manipulative behaviors of these sites, with clear explanations of each dark pattern implemented.
